# Employee-Mangement-System
In this world of growing technologies everything has been computerized. With
large number of works opportunities, the Human workforce has increased,
thus there is a need of a system which can handle the data of such a large
number of Employees in an organization. The “EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM” has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the
practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and, in
some cases, reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. The
application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the
data. It also provides error message while entering invalid data. No formal
knowledge is needed for the user to use this system. This project will allow
admin to add new employees after proper authentication. Database stores all
personal details of employees such as date of birth full name etc.
